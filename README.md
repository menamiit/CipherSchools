**Q1. React Concepts Applied: E-Commerce App Scenario**
*You're building an e-commerce web app.*
*You have a ProductCard component that displays a product‚Äôs name and price.*

1. How will you pass these values from the parent component?
   I will make use of Props to pass these values from parent component.
   e.g.
   ```js <ComponentName brand='Porsche', model='911'/>```
   
*Each product has a "Like" button that toggles between "Liked ‚ù§Ô∏è" and "Like ü§ç."*
