**Q1. React Concepts Applied: E-Commerce App Scenario**
*You're building an e-commerce web app.*
   
   *You have a ProductCard component that displays a product‚Äôs name and price.*

1. How will you pass these values from the parent component?

   Ans -> I will make use of Props to pass these values from parent component.
   
   e.g.
   ```js <ProductCart brand='Samsung', model='S26'/>```

   
   *Each product has a "Like" button that toggles between "Liked ‚ù§Ô∏è" and "Like ü§ç."*

2. How will you implement this toggle using useState?

   Ans -> I‚Äôd use the useState hook inside ProductCard to toggle the like status. Something like:

   eg.
   ```js
   const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);

   <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>
     {liked ? 'Liked ‚ù§Ô∏è' : 'Like ü§ç'}
   </button>
   ```


   *There‚Äôs a search input at the top to filter products as the user types.*

3. How will you manage this input using a controlled component approach?

   Ans -> For search, I‚Äôd keep the input controlled by using useState in the parent component. For example:
   ```js
   const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");

   <input
     type="text"
     value={searchTerm}
     onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
     placeholder="Search products..."
   />
   ```


   *Your app supports light and dark themes.*

4. How will you share the current theme across all components using useContext?

   Ans -> I‚Äôd create a ThemeContext using createContext and wrap my app in a ThemeProvider. Inside any component, I‚Äôd use useContext(ThemeContext) to get the current theme and toggle function.
   ```js
   const ThemeContext = createContext();

   const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
     const toggleTheme = () => setTheme(prev => prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
   
     return (
       <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
         {children}
       </ThemeContext.Provider>
     );
   };
   ```


*The "Checkout" page should only be accessible to logged-in users.*

5. How will you protect this route to restrict unauthenticated access?

   Ans -> To protect the "Checkout" page and restrict it to logged-in users, I would implement route guarding using React Router. This involves checking the user's authentication status before allowing access to certain routes.

I would create a custom component that wraps protected routes. Inside this component, I‚Äôd use either context or global state to determine if the user is authenticated. If the user is not logged in, they would be redirected to the login page instead of being allowed to access the checkout route.

This approach makes sure that only authenticated users can view or interact with sensitive pages like Checkout, improving security.
